    "Building a **CIFG** variant of the LSTM using the method introduced in the referred paper. According to the paper, the CIFG variant uses only one gate for gating both the input and the cell recurrent self-connection which is a modification of GRU. This is equivalent to setting $f_t = 1 - i_t$ instead of learning the forget gate independently. "
