# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repo Includes some of the machine learning projects that I have worked on. Some of the data sets are taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and some of them are taken from [UCI machine learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). Usually each folder is specified with the name of the model that I have worked on. For instance, `01-Linear Regression folder` includes the dataset and the Linear Regression model that I have worked on. **Note** that description of each data set is presented in the jupyter notebook where its associated model has been developed. The following is the list of the models that I have worked on:

1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/01-Linear%20Regression)
2. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/02-Logistic%20regression)
3. [K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/03-K%20Nearest%20Neighbor(KNN))
4. [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/04-Support%20Vector%20Machines(SVM))
5. [K Means Clustering](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/06-%20K%20means%20Clustering)
6. [Principal Componenet Analysis (PCA)](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/07-Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20(PCA))
7. [Deep Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network (DNN & RNN)](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/08-Artifitial%20Neural%20Network)
8. [Time Series Data Analysis and Forecasting using RNN](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/09-TimeSeriesDataAnalysis)
9. [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/10-NLP/12-NLP)
10. [Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU)](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/GRU_Shakespeare_Language_Model)
11. [Regular Expression Maching](https://github.com/mohazari/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Regular_expression_matching) 


*Disclaimer*: Some of the models that are presented here are the projects that I have performed through my onlined courses that I have taken from [coursera](https://www.coursera.org) or [udemy](https://www.udemy.com)
